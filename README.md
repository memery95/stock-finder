# API Hack Capstone
# IMPORTANT: THE API USED IN THE PROJECT HAS A LIMIT OF 5 CALLS PER MINUTE, EVERY SEARCH USES 2 CALLS
## Stock Finder

Stock searching just got easier.

### Further Improvements

The API to get the stock info has a 5 call per minute limit and unforuantely with using the google 
chart API I needed to make another fetch call to get the stock data. 

The project might throw an error but it's about reaching the api limit after 2 searches.
